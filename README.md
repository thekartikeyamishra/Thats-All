# Thats-All
This Python script generates a video featuring animated text with scaling and centering effects. It leverages OpenCV for image processing, MoviePy for video editing, and NumPy for array manipulation.

Features:

Animated Text: Create visually appealing videos with text that grows in size over time.
Customizable: Easily modify the text string, font properties, video dimensions, and animation parameters for a personalized touch.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems with compatible Python installations and libraries.

Usage:

Install Libraries: Ensure you have OpenCV (pip install opencv-python), MoviePy (pip install moviepy), and NumPy (pip install numpy) installed.
Edit Script: Customize the text variable, font properties, video dimensions, and animation settings within the script.
Run Script: Execute the script using Python (python fancy_text.py).
Output Video: A video named "fancy_text.mp4" will be generated in the same directory.
Additional Notes:

Experiment with different animation techniques by modifying the animate_text function.
Consider incorporating audio tracks or background images for a richer video experience.
Explore advanced video editing features available in MoviePy for further customization.
